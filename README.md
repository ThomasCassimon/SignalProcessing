## GUI
This session will require building a Graphical User Interface in Matlab. It would be nice if you could have a look at
following Matlab tutorial before starting this session.

Take into account that you are developing a program which is going to be used by a researcher in physiotherapy.
Make your program user friendly and fool proof. Moreover the researcher has to be able to choose from a
number of possibilities and has to be able to adjust certain parameters. If necessary, add a little help file. Please
document your code, so it can be read and adjusted by a fellow student if necessary.
## Assignment
1. You must be able to load data from an excel file, choosing a directory and file
2. After opening the excel file the user has to be able to select limited data from a chosen column
3. Make two graphical windows so you can plot your data before and after applying chosen operations.
4. Give the user the opportunity to choose a window function, give at least four options.
5. Give the user the opportunity to select a method to remove noise. It is his/her option to decide how much noise will be removed and which method is most adequate.
6. The user should be able to save the altered data, adding comments about the selected methods/parameters so
(s)he can repeat the experiment if necessary.
7. The user should be able to choose to plot the frequency analysis before and after altering the data, to compare.
