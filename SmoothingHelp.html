            <h1>Smoothing functions</h1>
            <h2>Quadratic Regression</h2>
            Extrema are preserved quite accurately. The smoothing is not very extreme. It smooths out the smallest peaks of the signal.
            <h2>Robust Quadratic Regression</h2>
            A nice middle ground between keeping the peaks in place and smoothing out a lot of the peak in the signal.
            <h2>Savitzky-Golay Filter</h2>
            Smooths more extreme. The peaks of the signal are reduced more than when using another function.
